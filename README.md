# Unito Experimental and Behavioral Economics -- spring term 2024

## Welcome!

Here you'll find all the material needed for the Experimental Economics course.

-   details on how you will be marked + syllabus
-   Lecture slides & handout
-   Papers to be used for the take-home article reports
-   Instructions, data and results for the class/online experiments

## Bring your PC

It would be better if you brought your PC to class. Some experiments will be run with paper and pencil, but others will be run online and you'll need to have a PC to do that. Sometimes your phone might be enough, but not always.

## Exam rules

Exam rules are available in the Exam section of the github repo -- [here](Exam/Exam_Rules.pdf).

## Articles to choose from

To choose one, paper, go here: [this google spreadhseet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zK3xTGV_x3L0dNFsaICpJPAo8NGRS0XFOrhBMQ_QXY8/edit?usp=sharing) and mark your name beside one of the papers. First come, first served, and you manage eventual conflicts among yourselves. Just one rule: \\textit{no duplicates}. Once a paper has been assigned, it's over and you have to choose another.
